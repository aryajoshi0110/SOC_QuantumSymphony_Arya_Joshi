This is the repository is have created for my SOC project, Quantum Symphony: Orchestrating Machine Learning in the Quantum World.

At the time of submitting the mentee checkpoint form, this repo contains the pdf file and code for Assignment 1 which was given by our mentors. 

Additionally, the repo contains a code file for gradient descent as the Assignment 2 of the project.

A new jupyter notebook titled Assignment 3 can also be viewed now, which contains the implementation of a neural network for image classification.

Finally, the folder named 'Final Task' contains the Jupyter file for the implementation of a research paper on Quantum GANs (which has also been included). The folder 'QGAN_Data' contains the data that is used as training dataset for the model.
