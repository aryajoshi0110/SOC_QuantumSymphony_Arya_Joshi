This is the repository is have created for my SOC project, Quantum Symphony: Orchestrating Machine Learning in the Quantum World.
At the time of submitting the mentee checkpoint form, this repo contains the pdf file and code for Assignment 1 which was given by our mentors. 
Additionally, the repo contains a code file for gradient descent as an assignment.
More code files will be uploaded to this repo as the project progresses further...
